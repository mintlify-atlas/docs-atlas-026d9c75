│   ├── components/     # Reusable UI components
│   ├── store/          # Context providers (where applicable)
│   ├── hooks/          # Custom hooks (where applicable)
│   ├── App.jsx         # Main application component
│   └── main.jsx        # Application entry point
├── public/             # Static assets
└── package.json        # Dependencies and scripts
```

## Getting Started

Each project includes starter code in the source repository:

<CodeGroup>
```bash Project Management
cd "code/09 Practice Project - Project Management/01-starting-project"
npm install
npm run dev
```

```bash React Quiz
cd "code/13 Demo Project - React Quiz/01-starting-project"
npm install
npm run dev
```

```bash Food Order
cd "code/18 Practice Project - Food Order/01-starting-project"
npm install
npm run dev
```
</CodeGroup>

<Note>
Each project folder contains multiple subfolders representing different stages of completion. Start with `01-starting-project` and refer to later stages if you need help.
