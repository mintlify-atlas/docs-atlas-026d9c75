## Overview

Code snapshots are complete, ready-to-run copies of the code as it appears at specific points throughout the React course. Each snapshot captures the exact state of the project during the video lectures, allowing you to compare your code with the instructor's or jump to any point in the course.

## Why Code Snapshots?

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Compare Your Code" icon="code-compare">
    The primary purpose of code snapshots is to help you verify your implementation. If something isn't working as expected, you can compare your code with the snapshot to identify differences.
    
    This is especially useful when debugging issues or understanding why your output differs from the course videos.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Jump to Any Point" icon="forward">
    Missed a lecture or want to start from a specific section? Code snapshots let you begin from any point in the course without having to complete all previous sections.
    
    Simply download the starting snapshot for your desired section and continue from there.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Learn by Exploration" icon="magnifying-glass">
    Study the finished implementations to understand how different React concepts work together. You can experiment with modifications in a working codebase.
    
    This hands-on exploration reinforces the concepts taught in the lectures.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Recover from Mistakes" icon="rotate-left">
    Made changes that broke your project? Instead of spending hours debugging, you can reference the snapshot to see what changed or start fresh from a known working state.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Types of Snapshots

Most course sections include three types of snapshots:

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="Starting" icon="flag">
    The initial project state at the beginning of a section. Use this to code along with the lectures.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Intermediate" icon="ellipsis">
    Checkpoints taken during longer sections. These help you verify your progress without waiting until the end.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Finished" icon="check">
    The final, complete code after all lectures in a section. Perfect for comparison and reference.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## What's Included

Each code snapshot contains:

- **Complete source code** - All React components, utilities, and configuration files
- **Package dependencies** - The `package.json` with all required dependencies
- **Assets** - Images, stylesheets, and other resources used in the project
- **Configuration** - Build tools, linters, and development environment setup

<Note>
  Code snapshots are taken directly from the course recordings and reflect the exact code you see in the videos, including any typos or issues that are later fixed in subsequent lectures.
</Note>

## Repository Structure

All code snapshots are organized in the `/code/` folder of the course repository:

```
code/
├── 01 Getting Started/
│   ├── edited-first-app/
│   └── react-vs-vanilla-js-example/
├── 02 JS Refresher/
│   └── code/
├── 03 React Essentials/
│   ├── 01-starting-project/
│   ├── 02-creating-using-first-component/
│   └── ...
└── [34 sections total]
```

Each section folder contains multiple snapshots representing different stages of development covered in that section's lectures.
