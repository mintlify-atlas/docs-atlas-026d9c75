icon: 'play'
---

## Quick Start

Follow these steps to run any code snapshot on your local machine:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to the snapshot folder">
    Open your terminal and navigate to the specific snapshot you want to use:
    
    ```bash
    cd code/03\ React\ Essentials/01-starting-project
    ```
    
    <Tip>
      Use tab completion in your terminal to avoid typing the full path with spaces.
    </Tip>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Install dependencies">
    Install all required npm packages:
    
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
    
    This downloads all dependencies listed in `package.json`. The first install may take a few minutes.
    
    <Warning>
      Make sure you have Node.js installed (version 18 or higher recommended). Check with `node --version`.
    </Warning>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Start the development server">
    Run the development server:
    
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    
    Your application will start, typically at `http://localhost:5173` (for Vite projects) or `http://localhost:3000` (for Create React App projects).
  </Step>

  <Step title="Open in browser">
    Open the URL shown in your terminal in your web browser. You should see the application running exactly as it appears in the course video.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Comparing Your Code

When your code isn't working as expected, use this workflow:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Visual Comparison" icon="eye">
    1. Open the snapshot folder in your code editor
    2. Open your project folder in a separate window
    3. Compare files side-by-side
    
    **VS Code Tip:** Right-click a file and select "Compare with..." to see a diff view.
    
    ```bash
    # Or use diff in terminal
    diff your-project/src/App.jsx code/03\ React\ Essentials/02-creating-using-first-component/src/App.jsx
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="File-by-File Review" icon="file">
    Focus on the files you've been working on:
    
    - **Components** - Check component structure, props, and JSX
    - **State management** - Verify `useState`, `useReducer` calls
    - **Event handlers** - Ensure functions are properly bound
    - **Imports** - Confirm all imports are correct and paths match
    
    <Tip>
      Start with the file mentioned in any error messages, then work backwards through the component tree.
    </Tip>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Console & Network" icon="bug">
    Check browser developer tools:
    
    - **Console tab** - Look for JavaScript errors or warnings
    - **Network tab** - Verify API calls and asset loading
    - **React DevTools** - Inspect component props and state
    
    Compare the console output between your project and the snapshot.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Common Use Cases

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Starting a New Section" icon="rocket">
    **Scenario:** You want to begin Section 10 without completing Section 9.
    
    **Solution:**
    ```bash
    cd code/10\ Advanced\ State\ Management/01-starting-project
    npm install
    npm run dev
    ```
    
    You now have the starting point for Section 10 ready to go.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Debugging Issues" icon="wrench">
    **Scenario:** Your app crashes but it works in the video.
    
    **Solution:**
    1. Find the corresponding snapshot
    2. Run the snapshot to confirm it works
    3. Compare your code file-by-file
    4. Focus on recently changed files
  </Card>

  <Card title="Skipping Ahead" icon="forward-fast">
    **Scenario:** You want to see the finished version before coding.
    
    **Solution:**
    Look for folders named `finished`, `final`, or numbered highest in the section.
    
    ```bash
    cd code/07\ Styling/08-finished
    npm install && npm run dev
    ```
  </Card>

  <Card title="Experimenting" icon="flask">
    **Scenario:** You want to test modifications without breaking your code.
    
    **Solution:**
    1. Copy a snapshot to a new location
    2. Make your experimental changes
    3. Keep your original code intact
    
    ```bash
    cp -r code/11\ Side\ Effects/03-useeffect-not-needed ~/experiments/
    ```
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Working with Different Project Types

The course uses different build tools throughout:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Vite Projects">
    Most modern sections use Vite:
    
    ```bash
    npm install
    npm run dev    # Starts dev server
    npm run build  # Creates production build
    ```
    
    Default URL: `http://localhost:5173`
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Next.js Projects">
    Sections 25-25b use Next.js:
    
    ```bash
    npm install
    npm run dev    # Starts Next.js dev server
    npm run build  # Creates optimized build
    npm start      # Runs production build
    ```
    
    Default URL: `http://localhost:3000`
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Create React App">
    Some earlier sections may use CRA:
    
    ```bash
    npm install
    npm start      # Starts dev server
    npm run build  # Creates production build
    ```
    
    Default URL: `http://localhost:3000`
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="npm install fails" icon="circle-xmark">
    **Problem:** Dependency installation errors
    
    **Solutions:**
    - Update Node.js to version 18 or higher
    - Clear npm cache: `npm cache clean --force`
    - Delete `node_modules` and `package-lock.json`, then retry
    - Try `npm install --legacy-peer-deps`
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Port already in use" icon="circle-xmark">
    **Problem:** Error: Port 5173 (or 3000) is already in use
    
    **Solutions:**
    - Stop other development servers
    - Kill the process using the port:
      ```bash
      # Find and kill process on port 5173
      lsof -ti:5173 | xargs kill -9
      ```
    - Use a different port: `npm run dev -- --port 3001`
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Code doesn't match video" icon="circle-xmark">
    **Problem:** Snapshot code looks different from the video
    
    **Explanation:**
    This is normal! The course may have been updated, or you might be looking at a different snapshot stage.
    
    **Solutions:**
    - Check the snapshot folder name (starting vs intermediate vs finished)
    - Verify you're in the correct section folder
    - Remember that snapshots reflect the exact moment they were captured
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Module not found errors" icon="circle-xmark">
    **Problem:** Cannot find module 'react' or other packages
    
    **Solutions:**
    - Ensure you ran `npm install` in the correct directory
    - Check that `node_modules` folder exists
    - Verify `package.json` is in the same directory
    - Try deleting `node_modules` and reinstalling
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Note>
  If you're still experiencing issues after trying these solutions, post in the course Q&A section with:
  - The specific section and snapshot name
  - Your Node.js version (`node --version`)
  - The complete error message
  - Your operating system
</Note>

## Best Practices

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Code Along First" icon="keyboard">
    Always try to code along with the lectures before checking snapshots. This reinforces learning and helps identify where you might need extra practice.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Don't Copy-Paste" icon="ban">
    When comparing code, type the corrections manually rather than copying. This helps build muscle memory and understanding.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Keep Snapshots Clean" icon="broom">
    Don't modify the original snapshot folders. Copy them elsewhere if you want to experiment, keeping the originals as reference.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Use Version Control" icon="git">
    Initialize a git repository for your project to track your own changes:
    
    ```bash
    git init
    git add .
    git commit -m "Initial commit"
    ```
  </Card>
