description: Understand how the React course resources are organized across 34 sections, including code snapshots, attachments, and additional materials
---

## Repository overview

The course resources repository is organized into three main folders, each serving a specific purpose:

```bash
react-complete-guide-resources/
├── code/              # Code snapshots for all 34 sections
├── attachments/       # Lecture attachments and downloadables
└── other/             # Slides and update guides
```

## Code snapshots

The `code/` folder contains **34 section folders**, each corresponding to a course section. Every section includes multiple code snapshots that represent different stages of development.

### What are code snapshots?

Code snapshots are taken directly from the course recordings and reflect the exact code you see in the videos. They serve multiple purposes:

- **Compare your code** - Check your work against the instructor's implementation
- **Jump to any point** - Start from any stage without watching all previous lectures
- **Debug issues** - Use working code as a reference when troubleshooting
- **Explore concepts** - Run and modify the code to understand how it works

### Snapshot naming convention

Snapshots follow a numbered naming pattern that indicates their order:

```bash
code/03 React Essentials/
├── 01-starting-project
├── 02-creating-using-first-component
├── 03-using-outputting-dynamic-values
├── 04-html-attributes-dynamically-image-files
├── 05-cmp-props
└── ...
```

The numbers correspond to the lecture or concept being demonstrated.
