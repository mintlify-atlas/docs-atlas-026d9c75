## Access the repository

All course resources are available in the course repository. You can access them in two ways:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Clone the repository" icon="git">
    Get all resources at once with Git
  </Card>
  <Card title="Download individually" icon="download">
    Download specific files or sections as needed
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Clone the entire repository

Cloning gives you immediate access to all 34 sections of course materials:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd react-complete-guide-resources
```

### Download specific sections

If you prefer to download only what you need, navigate to the specific section folder and download the files or folders you want to work with.

## Running code snapshots

Code snapshots are designed to help you compare your code with the instructor's code from the videos. Here's how to run them:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to the snapshot folder">
    Open your terminal and navigate to the specific code snapshot you want to run:
    
    ```bash
    cd code/"03 React Essentials"/01-starting-project
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Install dependencies">
    Install the required npm packages:
    
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
    
    <Note>
      This step is required for each snapshot you want to run. Dependencies are not shared between snapshots.
    </Note>
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Start the development server">
    Run the development server using Vite:
    
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    
    The application will typically be available at `http://localhost:5173`
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Open in your browser">
    Visit the local URL shown in your terminal to see the application running.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Understanding the project structure

Most React projects in this course use Vite as the build tool. Here's what you'll find in a typical snapshot:

```bash
├── package.json          # Project dependencies and scripts
├── vite.config.js        # Vite configuration
├── index.html            # Entry HTML file
├── public/               # Static assets
└── src/
    ├── main.jsx          # Application entry point
    ├── App.jsx           # Main App component
    ├── components/       # React components
    └── assets/           # Images, styles, etc.
```

### Key files explained

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="package.json">
    Defines project dependencies and npm scripts. The course projects typically use:
    
    ```json
    {
      "scripts": {
        "dev": "vite",
        "build": "vite build",
        "preview": "vite preview"
      },
      "dependencies": {
        "react": "^19.0.0",
        "react-dom": "^19.0.0"
      }
    }
    ```
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="src/main.jsx">
    The entry point that renders your React application:
    
    ```jsx
    import React from 'react'
    import ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client'
    import App from './App.jsx'
    
    ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root')).render(
      <React.StrictMode>
        <App />
      </React.StrictMode>,
    )
    ```
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="src/App.jsx">
    Your main application component where most of the React code lives. Starting projects often begin with a simple structure:
    
    ```jsx
    function App() {
      return (
        <>
          <h1 className="my-8 text-center text-5xl font-bold">Hello World</h1>
        </>
      );
    }
    
    export default App;
    ```
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Working with lecture attachments

Lecture attachments contain standalone files mentioned in specific course lectures:

- **JavaScript files** - Helper functions, data files, configuration files
- **PDF documents** - Reference materials and summaries
- **ZIP files** - Complete starting projects for sections

Simply download the attachment for the lecture you're watching and use it as instructed in the video.

## Common commands reference

Here are the most frequently used commands when working with course projects:

<CodeGroup>
```bash Install dependencies
npm install
```

```bash Start development server
npm run dev
```

```bash Build for production
npm run build
```

```bash Preview production build
npm run preview
```
</CodeGroup>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="npm install fails">
    **Solution:** Ensure you have Node.js version 14 or higher installed. Check your version:
    
    ```bash
    node --version
    ```
    
    If needed, update Node.js from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org)
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Port already in use">
    **Solution:** If port 5173 is already in use, Vite will automatically use the next available port. Check your terminal output for the correct URL.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Module not found errors">
    **Solution:** Make sure you've run `npm install` in the correct directory. Each snapshot has its own dependencies.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Code doesn't match the video">
    **Solution:** Code snapshots are taken directly from course recordings. Make sure you're using the snapshot that corresponds to the specific lecture you're watching.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Warning>
  If you encounter issues not covered here, please post in the course Q&A section with details about your problem, including error messages and your Node.js version.
</Warning>

## Next steps

Now that you know how to run the code, explore the [repository structure](/repository-structure) to understand how all 34 sections are organized and find the resources you need.
